# csp-netflix
simple react app for basic Netflix clone front-end 
I say basic but it uses Firebase for Data, Auth and Stripe Payment gateway 
All set up in react with react-redux as well as react-router and then basic CSS for design and feel 
you have to look at the master file to see the SRC pages, have fun.
